## Our Journey creating 8-bit-bartender

Deciding who would work on what part of the app was not difficult choice for the 6 of us.

Ran into issues with making 2 frameworks work together but after some time and a complete group effort problems were solved

Calling both server APIs were a struggle but after some trial and error we got the information to appear in the html from the button clicks.
